# Sample Scala Event Consumer for Amazon Kinesis

## Introduction

This is an example event consumer for [Amazon Kinesis] [kinesis]
written in Scala and packaged as an SBT project.

This was built by the [Snowplow Analytics] [snowplow] team,
as part of a proof of concept for porting our event collection and
enrichment processes to run on Kinesis.

This has been built to run in conjunction with the 
[kinesis-example-scala-producer] [producer].

## Pre-requisites

This project requires Java 1.7 and SBT 0.13.0.

If you are running Vagrant, you can run it using the Snowplow
[dev environment] [dev-environment]. Make sure you run the [jvm-7] [jvm-7]
Ansible Playbook to install both the required Java version and SBT. 
Instructions on using Ansible to run the different playbooks can be found on the 
[dev environment README] [dev-env-readme].

## Building

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/kinesis-example-scala-consumer.git

Then compile:

    $ cd kinesis-example-scala-consumer
    $ sbt compile
    
## Unit testing

To come.

## Usage

We recommend running the producer *after* you have run the 
[kinesis-example-scala-producer] [producer]. 

The event producer has the following command-line interface:

```
kinesis-example-scala-consumer: Version 0.0.2. Copyright (c) 2013, Snowplow
Analytics Ltd.

Usage: kinesis-example-scala-consumer[OPTIONS]

OPTIONS
--config filename  Configuration file. Defaults to "resources/default.conf"
                   (within .jar) if not set
```

## Running

Create your own config file:

    $ cp src/main/resources/default.conf my.conf

Now edit it and update the AWS credentials:

```js
aws {
  access-key: "cpf"
  secret-key: "cpf"
}
```

Make sure that the AWS credentials you use hav the permissions required to:

1. Request and read from the Kinesis stream specified in the config file
2. Create tables in DynamoDB

You can leave the rest of the settings for now.

Next, run the event consumer, making sure to specify your new config file:

    $ sbt "run --config my.conf"

## Next steps

Fork this project and adapt it into your own custom Kinesis event consumer.
